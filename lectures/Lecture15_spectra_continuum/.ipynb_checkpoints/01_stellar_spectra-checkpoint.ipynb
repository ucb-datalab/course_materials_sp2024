    "This lab is all about stellar spectroscopy.  We're going to build a data-driven model of stars from the APOGEE survey and use it to measure the chemical abundances of stars throughout the Milky Way.  In the process, you'll learn how to build a data-driven model from scratch as well as work with neural networks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also learn about stellar spectra, stellar chemistry, and stellar evolution.  This notebook provides broad background on stellar spectra including the basic properties of stars, why their spectra have features, the physics of stellar atmospheres, and how most contemporary stellar atmosphere models work.  Much of this background will be important for interpreting results from your data-driven model and sanity checking them."
