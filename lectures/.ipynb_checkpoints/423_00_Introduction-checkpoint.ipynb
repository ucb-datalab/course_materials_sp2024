    " - Q11: In several cases, the Kiel diagrams were not being interpreted correctly.  There seemed to be some confusion over the axes and how they mapped to stellar features.\n",
    " - Q2 asked you to compute logg for 3 different stellar evolution points by hand. Answers greatly varied for this (e.g., SI units, no reference to radius)\n",
    " - Plotting: [Rainbow colormaps](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/end-of-the-rainbow-new-map-scale-is-more-readable-by-people-who-are-color-blind/)\n",
    " - Mapping absoprtion lines to spectral features (spectra are in air, line lists are reported in vaccuum; [discussion here](https://www.astro.uu.se/valdwiki/Air-to-vacuum%20conversion#:~:text=The%20conversion%20is%20then%3A%20Î»,Opt.))\n",
    " - Some models didn't show that their predicted spectra varied with metallicity...not clear why from write ups\n",
